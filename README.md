##Portfolio Website

Welcome to my first portfolio website! üåê This project is a simple demonstration of my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing basic web technologies as part of my skill set.

As a penetration tester, this portfolio highlights my foundational knowledge of web development, which complements my expertise in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in web applications.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The website is not responsive yet, but it serves as a foundational piece to showcase my technical skills.

Feel free to explore the code and structure!
